    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>I wasn't in for this lesson, but my target was to find about what we did in the lesson.</td>

    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes, I found out from my peers that we were sharing our identity maps and learning about how we feel when people judge us.</td>

    <td>Obviously, my learning would have been much better if I had been present in the lesson, especially as the lesson wasn’t really the sort you can catch up on. I think that the amount I learnt from my peers about what they learnt in the lesson could have been higher (instead of just what we did in the lesson).</td>
