This would have meant that I improved my knowledge of these issues further, as well as knowing what I should and shouldn’t do relating to them.

    <td>To improve my learning if I am absent during a lesson, I need to spend even more time finding out the details of what we did in the lesson. As well as this, I need to make sure that I am talking to many of my peers so that I can really find out exactly what I missed.</td>
