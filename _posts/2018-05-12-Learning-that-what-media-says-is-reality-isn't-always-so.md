    <td>I think that the first task (standing in different places depending on my thoughts) could have ended up with me learning more. This task also took far too long, which limited the amount that I could learn during the rest of the lesson. The way I participated in the discussion also could have been better.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>When doing a task such as the first one in this lesson, I need to be constantly challenging my decisions, asking myself, "Is this really the case?". Even though I do not think that I contributed to the delay during the lesson, I need to make sure that I don't. Finally, even though I was giving answers, I need to make sure that I am asking questions as well.</td>
