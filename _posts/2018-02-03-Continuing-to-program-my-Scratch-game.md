    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>This week I had quite a few problems such as programming the bullets and the one mentioned above but I didn't ask for much help.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>To solve some problems I reflected on how I had solved similar problems when programming Space Invaders.</td>

    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I remained engaged with the task, pushing myself to try different approaches and to remain interested.</td>

    <td>I think that the way that I learnt new skills could have gone better (see below). I think that I could have also tried to push myself to think in more creative ways.</td>

    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>To improve my learning I think that I need to help others who are stuck, just suggesting solutions. This would, as well as helping them, also improve my learning (I can also hear what they suggest). To solve problems more creatively, I need to try out using new blocks, which might solve my problems easily.</td>
