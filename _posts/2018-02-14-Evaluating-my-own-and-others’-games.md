    <td>To evaluate my own and two other games.</td>

    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes, I successfully evaluated the games and started to improve my own one.</td>

    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I reflected on the outcome of my game to find ways to improve it.</td>

    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I remained focused and always engaged with the games, how they were good and how they could be improved.</td>

    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that the way that I evaluated my own game could have gone better: I never had time to really look through my game to find glitches which hadn't yet been found. I also think that the amount of detail my peers put into the evaluation of my game could be improved. It would help me to improve my game even more.

    <td>I need to perhaps review my game more thoroughly the night before the lesson so that in the lesson I remember clearly what needs to be fixed or what is good about my game. This might significantly improve the final version of my game.  </td>
