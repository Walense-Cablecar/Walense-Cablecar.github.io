    <td>Persevering</td>

    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I worked on my own and didn’t ask for help even on level 3-6.</td>

    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I reflected on techniques used in previous levels to solve ones which I was stuck on.</td>

    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I focused on my own work, especially during difficult levels levels.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>The speed at which I was working could have been better so I would have completed all of the work. Also, maybe the amount of commands that I used to solve the problems could have been lower. In cases when I was running out of space for commands this would have helped greatly. </td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to really not let my mind drift into any solution apart from the one that I am working on while testing a solution. I also need to try thinking of even more approaches to levels such as 3-6, so my thinking won’t be limited. Finally, I need to see if I can somehow shorten my program if I am running out of space for commands</td>
