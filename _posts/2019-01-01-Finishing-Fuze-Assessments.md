    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>I had completed a few assessments and worked through the Fuze booklet.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To complete the fourth assessment, and possibly resume work on the breadboards.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes, we completed this assessment but did not have much time for the breadboard. However, this was planned.</td>

    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>We worked without help from a teacher or other peer.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>We used our knowledge from mistakes when we worked through the chapter previously.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>We were not distracted and therefore managed to complete the task.</td>

    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>When working on the LEDs (breadboards) we attempted the same thing as what we had successfully completed a few weeks previously. Even though last week we had little success with this, I think we should have moved on to something which is of the same difficulty and complexity. This would have kept us even more interested and therefore also raised our chances of success.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I need to vary my work more to keep me as interested as possible. However, I need to make sure that what I have chosen is not too big a leap, as it is important to challenge myself, but not to the level that I have no idea what to do.</td>
