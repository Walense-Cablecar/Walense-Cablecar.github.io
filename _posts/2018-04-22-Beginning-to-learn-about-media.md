    <td>I think that I could have been more independent when I was changing the Bingo document so that I could edit it. I also think that even though I was focusing on what was being said in the discussion, I could have contributed more.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I need to listen more carefully to anything which the teacher is saying so that I don't try to solve a problem the wrong way. As well as this, I need to persevere more, even if I am pressured for time and not accept too much help, if any. Finally, I should ask more questions if I have any and give more answers, even if I am not sure that they are right.</td>
