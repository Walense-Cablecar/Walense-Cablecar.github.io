    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>I had a scratch account and some previous knowledge but had not started the game yet.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>My target was to program the spaceship and laser so they could move.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Not quite in the lesson because I had to finish my work at home</td>

    <td>How did you use your learning habits this week?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>When my spaceship didn't move left, i looked back on my code and changed it multiple times until it worked.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I asked myself what was wrong with the program</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>Even when my program wasn’t working and I had tried some ways of fixing it I didn’t ask for help.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I now know how not to make that mistake again.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>Again I stayed focused and didn’t allow myself to be distracted.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could have finished faster so that we could program as well as learn how to program the alien boss in the lesson. </td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to try to identify the problem faster and spend less time on costumes so that the class can do more in the lesson.</td>
