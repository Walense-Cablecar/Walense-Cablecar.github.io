  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>We often realised halfway through coding that we had to add another piece of coding in. This was not efficient and wasted time. This also led to us not quite finishing an assessment at the end of the lesson, which will lead to us having to spend time this week loading up the program.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I need to change the way I approach a problem. I need to instead of diving straight in and start coding, read the problem carefully a few times. Then I should make a quick, mental plan before finally starting to code. This should minimise problems and therefore time spent, even with taking more time in the initial stages.</td>
