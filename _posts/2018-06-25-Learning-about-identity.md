    <td>To learn more about what identity is, other key information and begin to produce an identity map.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes, I learnt about identity and work on the map was finished at home.</td>

    <td>I could have gotten more of my identity map done during the lesson, as I think that I wasn’t giving it my full concentration. This would have meant that I had less to do for homework.</td>

    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I need to think ahead and not let myself get distracted by others during the lesson. I also should encourage them to get on with their work, because if everyone is working distractions are not created.</td>
