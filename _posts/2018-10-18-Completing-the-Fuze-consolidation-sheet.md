  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>I had completed a large section of the Fuze booklet and knew some coding concepts</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To complete the worksheet and the extension.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes, I completed the worksheet and the extension in good time, and resumed work on defchars.</td>

    <td>How did you use your learning habits this week?</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>Me and my partner had many coding errors. We had to try many things to get the code working.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>During work on the Defchars, I asked about how to do certain sums on Sheets.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>Me and my partner completed the work and extension without any help from the teacher.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I reflected on previous coding and coding errors to help me with this task.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>When we finished, we asked for work straight away, without dawdling around.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think we could have worked more independently by using the booklet less during this task, since we used it for support from the beginning. Also, me and my partner's communications weren’t perfect, affecting our working speed.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I will start without using a booklet (or other form of help) and then only use it if I get stuck. This will make my brain work harder and therefore help me learn better. I will also make sure to take my peer’s advice earlier, since it is likely that their suggestions will work.</td>
