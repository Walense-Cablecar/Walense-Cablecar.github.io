    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>I had done some e-safety before in primary school</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To learn about internet safety and child exploitation and start creating an academic poster about e-safety.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>No, I finished the first part of my poster for homework.</td>

    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>As well as discussing with the class, I worked independently on my poster.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I had made such posters before: I remembered what they were like and their flaws to help me to create a better poster this time.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I contributed to the class discussion and remained focused on my work.</td>

    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The amount of new information that I took away from the lesson could have been better, as I had done e-safety before and therefore knew quite a bit about e-safety before the lesson. The amount of work on my poster which I did in the lesson could have also been better. This is because I ended up switching between Google Docs and Google Drawings which obviously took some time.</td>

    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to ask more questions about the issues which I know less about (as long as they are relevant to the topic being discussed).. This would help me learn a lot more during the lesson. I also need to make sure that I am always listening and clear about what the task involves so that I don't end up wasting time.</td>
