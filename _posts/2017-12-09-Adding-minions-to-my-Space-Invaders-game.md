  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>I had created a laser, spaceship and alien boss but had no useful code for the minions.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To code the minions to clone themselves and move across and down the screen</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>No because  I had some problems with the code, but this was finished for homework.</td>

    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>Often my code went wrong, for example I had one extra alien, but i tried different solutions until it worked.</td>

    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>Even when my code failed, I just tried again without asking for help.</td>

    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I analysed my script and thought what I should try next based on past failures.</td>

    <td>I could have gotten more done in the lesson so that at home I would have more time to experiment with other skills and parts of the Space Invaders game. </td>

    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I need to work faster and more efficiently by following, for example, the worksheet more closely and only changing things, for instance numbers, that can be changed.</td>
