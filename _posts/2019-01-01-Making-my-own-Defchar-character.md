    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>I already understood and had created a simple character </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To make a more complex character, made of four Defchars.</td>

    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>No, I didn't finish the character.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>Putting four Defchars together wasn't working, so we looked over our code and made changes several times to try and make it work.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>Me and my partner worked mostly without help.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I was focused and engaged with drawing out, adding up and coding the Defchars.</td>

    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Obviously, the fact that I didn't finish could have been much better. I believe I didn’t finish because me and my partner were working on slightly different things. Neither of us finished as a result of this.
Also, I think I should have been more decisive on what I would work on, as I made several starts before deciding what I would do.</td>

    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I need to work together with my partner, even if I would slightly prefer to be doing something else. This way, we will be done twice as fast and have something solid to show. We then may be able to start on something a bit more individual.
Also, we should consider all the options before starting work, to ensure we don’t waste time with false starts.</td>
