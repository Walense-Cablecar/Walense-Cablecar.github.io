    <td>Persevering</td>

    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>When I was stuck on how to make my game more original, I didn't ask for help (I solved the problem myself).</td>

    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I reflected on what went well when I was writing down notes last week to make my planning even better his time.</td>

    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I remained focused on my game and not others during the lesson.</td>

    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could have worked faster during the lesson so I wouldn’t have had much to finish for homework. I also could have tried to make my game a little more challenging to code.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to try to be even more focused, blocking out any sources of distraction. I also need to add ideas to my plan that I can just drop out if necessary (if I find that I don’t have time). An example of this is that the enemy shooters, in addition to having increasing numbers, also shoot more bullets as the game progresses. </td>
