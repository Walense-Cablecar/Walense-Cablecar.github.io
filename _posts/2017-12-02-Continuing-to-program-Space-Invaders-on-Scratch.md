    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>I had already programmed the spaceship and laser on my game.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>My target was to program the alien boss to move across the screen at random intervals, to give a random number of points and disappear when touching the laser.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>I think I did because the alien boss could perform all of the tasks above by the end of the lesson.</td>

    <td>Persevering</td>

    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I questioned my own and others’ code when I was helping them.</td>

    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>As always we were working independently and I never resorted to ask for help</td>

    <td>Reflecting</td>

Also, I think I should put more effort into my work and try to work more things out for myself.</td>
