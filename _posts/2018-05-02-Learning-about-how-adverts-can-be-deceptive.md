    <td>I think that even though I did ask questions and provide some answers during the class  discussion, the amount of answers that I gave could have been better. I also think the amount of attention which I was paying could have been slightly larger.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I need to keep asking myself the questions asked by the teacher so that I come up with more and better answers (as well as questions). I also need to make sure that I am always paying full attention instead of, for example, focusing three quarters of my attention on the teacher. I can do this by not letting myself get distracted.</td>
