  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>I had worked through a fair part of the Fuze booklet with my partner.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To code the robot arm to move as specified.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Not really, we had mixed success, largely due to the robot arm getting stuck.</td>

    <td>How did you use your learning habits this week?</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>More often than not, our code didn't work properly. We tried many approaches, both trying to fix the robot arm and the code.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>Me and my partner worked largely without help.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I used some of my previous knowledge of coding to try to find errors.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I was focused on my work.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Obviously, the end outcome of the lesson could have been better: we only managed a few movements of the arm. Also, I think I should have perhaps put my own thoughts into the code, because it ended up largely being my partner's, who’s ideas I didn’t totally agree with.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I need to further explain to my partner my reasoning. Also, I need to spend longer on each strategy to solve the problems: this lesson I was quite hasty in one approach before moving onto another. This meant that maybe I was on the right track, but moving on quickly meant that we didn’t manage to fix the code.</td>
