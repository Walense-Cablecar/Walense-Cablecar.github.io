  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>I had some previous experience with Scratch, but no online account</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>My target was to make a Scratch account and program a sprite to move, but to be blocked by another sprite</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>I think I did: I successfully made a program that enabled the sprite to move around the screen using if...then...blocks and made the sprite bounce back slightly when it touched another sprite.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>When my programming didn't work at first and the sprite could easily move through the other sprite, I looked back at the program and fixed the problem, I didn’t give up.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I worked on my own and solved my own problems when they occurred.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I tried to find the the faulty piece of my program and then find why it was wrong to try to fix it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I didn’t allow myself to get distracted and focused to try to get through the task quickly.</td>

    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>As I finished slightly early, it would have been better if I had another short challenge to complete while others were finishing</td>

    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to experiment to challenge myself so that I get the most out of my learning, for example making the sprite move at different speeds.</td>
