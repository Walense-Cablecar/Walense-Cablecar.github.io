  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>We had already started some code on the robot arms, but this hadn't worked in the previous lesson.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To write a program that enables us to control the robot arm in real-time.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes, we had a fully functioning robot arm by the end of the end of the lesson.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>Often our code was incorrect or incomplete, so we persevered to work out what bits of code we needed.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>Me and my partner worked largely without help.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I had thought about my mistakes from last week, and used them to help me this week.</td>

    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I was engaged and interested throughout the lesson.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Although I was actively involved and working in the first half of the lesson, once we successfully managed to control the robot, I played around with this for the rest of the lesson. Although this was somewhat educational, it would have benefited my learning more if I had played around for, say, ten minutes and then moved on to more coding.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I need to make sure that what I am doing is benefiting my learning, or if it the most helpful thing to my learning. I can allow myself to investigate after some hard work, but only for a few minutes, and then I should move on to something new.</td>
