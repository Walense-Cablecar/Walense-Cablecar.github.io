  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>I knew about Defchars already.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To create my own Defchar and code it into the Fuzebox.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes, I even added motion of my character.</td>

    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I asked questions to find out how I could extend myself.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I worked mostly independently, (but with my partner).</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I used my knowledge from last week's lesson to assist me.</td>

    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I remained focused and asked questions to further engage.</td>

    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The speed of my work could have been much better: I had to make a new table for my Defchar because I accidentally messed up the one I was working on. This took lots of time up, which meant I only had a few minutes left to code.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I need to work faster but also check my work every few edits to avoid making large mistakes which could cost me lots of time. This would leave me more time for a further activity, which is often more interesting and leads me to take away more from the lesson.</td>
