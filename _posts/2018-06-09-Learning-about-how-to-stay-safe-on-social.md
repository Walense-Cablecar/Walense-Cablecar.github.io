    <td>I think that the communication within my group could have been much better. If it was better, we would have been able to get more work done in a shorter space of time without any confusion or points mentioned more than once. I think that by asking more questions I would learn more.</td>

    <td>Next time I need to make sure that everyone in my group knows what point they will be covering. If I spot a problem or large mistake, I should tell all of my group about it so that the same mistake isn't repeated. If I am curious about anything mentioned in class, I should ask about it even if I am not completely sure that it is a good question.</td>
