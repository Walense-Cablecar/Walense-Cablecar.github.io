  <tr>
    <td>I need to make sure that when I am about to make a decision, I am looking at it from all angles, also considering, for example, is this more important than this (not just whether this is important)? When we have come to a decision within the team that we are all relatively happy with, I need to stick to that and not make any changes, even if I slightly disagree. If I do make changes this can often completely unsettle the order of the rest of the situations.</td>
