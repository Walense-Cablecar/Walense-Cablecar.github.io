    <td>Starting point:</td>

    <td>To learn more about ads and the techniques they use to persuade people.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes, by looking at an advert in depths, I learnt a lot about the subtext of it and other techniques the creators used.</td>

    <td>The amount that I actually learnt from the group work could have been better, as I didn't really learn anything new from it. I also could have helped my peersâ€™ learning by preventing them from getting distracted (I could benefit from this as well). I also could have worked a bit less individually on the group task.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I need to challenge myself during certain tasks which I find a bit too simple (these are quite rare). This could be making up an extension for myself or helping others in my group. I also need to inform other members of my group if they are getting distracted or being too slow. This will mean that we can start on the task earlier, helping all  of our learning. If they are being too slow, I should wait for the members of my group so that we work together better without anybody in the group behind.</td>
