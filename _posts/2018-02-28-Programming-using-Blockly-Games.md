<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>I had used Scratch and a similar language to Blockly, but not Blockly itself.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To get to at least level ten in Maze, and improve my programming (including logic) skills.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes, I also started on the Bird mode.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I got stuck on level 10 for a long time, but I tried different approaches, using more and less "if...else" loops.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I worked on my own to solve the problems, even when they were difficult.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I reflected on how the previous levels had gone, or been solved, to find answers to the next problems.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I made sure to remain focused and engaged, even if something was, for example very easy.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that the way that I worked on the problems (mostly level 10) could have been better: I often spent too long on one approach. I also think that the amount that I learnt at the end of each level could have been larger so that a certain way to solve a problem was really registered in my mind.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to assess each approach before I spend a lot of time refining it, and if I don't think that it will work think of a different approach. Before I move on to the next level, I need to have a look and commit to memory how I solved that type of problem.</td>
