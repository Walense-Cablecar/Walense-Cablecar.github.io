    <td>Persevering</td>

    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>Even though we were working as a team when defining adware, ransomware, spyware and malware I still did my part independently.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I think that I could have learnt a bit more from researching the words listed above, as I only looked up and defined two. I also think that I could have participated in the class discussion  a bit more. This would perhaps help me extend my knowledge beyond what I would have learnt otherwise.</td>

    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to work faster when defining my words next time. With the time I have left, I could look up the words which others in my group are looking up, so that I learn more about the words than what my peers have written about them. I also need to not only give answers during a discussion, but ask questions to help me learn more.</td>
