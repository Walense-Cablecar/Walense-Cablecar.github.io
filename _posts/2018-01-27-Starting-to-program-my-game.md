    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>I had completely finished planning my game but had not yet started to code it</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To insert some sprites and start programming my Scratch game.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Almost, but since I had problems importing sprites it was finished for homework.</td>

    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I had a big problem importing sprites, but I tried many different approaches like changing the file type of the image and putting the image in different folders.</td>

    <td>Engagement</td>

    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I ended up wasting lots of time on the problem mentioned above, which meant that I had very little time to code during the lesson.  Another thing that could have gone better is the amount of code I managed to write in the little amount of time.</td>

    <td>Next time I just need to stop and come back to something if it is taking to long so that I overall produce more and better quality work. I also need to start with the simple code and then move on to the more complex parts so that I don’t get stuck with lots to do.</td>
