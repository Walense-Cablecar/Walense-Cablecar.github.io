  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>We had completed a few assessments, and had had a little previous success with the LEDs.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To complete another assessment and resume work on the breadboards.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Not really, since the assessment was quite long it was not completed, and we had limited success with the LEDs.</td>
  </tr>

    <td>How did you use your learning habits this week?</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>The LED often didn't work, but we tried different methods to make it work.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I questioned the teacher on how the breadboard worked to improve my knowledge</td>

    <td>Independence</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I used my knowledge from last time to help me with working the breadboard.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I remained focused and engaged with the work.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Even though the assessment was long, I think we should have been able to finish it in the lesson (we did complete one or two parts of it). I think maybe, even though we were fully engaged, we weren't working as efficiently as we could. </td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I need to spend a few minutes determining, for example, who is the faster typer in my pair. Doing things like this will ensure that we work as quickly and efficiently as possible, resulting in us getting more work done. We can then also spend more time on the breadboards and LEDs, which is more interesting and probably helps me learn new things more than the assessments do.</td>
